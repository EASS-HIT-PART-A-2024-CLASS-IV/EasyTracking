# Easy Tracking 
## Description
EasyTracking is a calorie counting application.
Inside the app, you can browse through different types of foods and add them to a meal in your personal "MyMeals"page.
The app uses an external API for many different types of foods, and their nutritional values, So you can be sure that you are keeping track of your calorie intake accurately.
On the "My Meals" page, you can change quantities, add or delete different foods from different meals and track the daily balance of calories you have consumed.
